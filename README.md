# DontBreakTheBeat
 Simple DJ concatenate songs by beats.

----

### Requirements

##### Python libs
- librosa
- moviepy

##### [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)

### Usage

Put all the musics(mp3 format) you would like to concatenate in the musics folder and run main.py. The program will generate a output.mp3 and a playlist.txt.

Some musics may not have strong beats at the beginning and at the end so the result may be variant according to this. I recommend using songs with similar bpms to get the best quality. Or you can use lots of songs with gradually increasing bpms.
